# ProjectHoriseon

This project was given to me by an imaginary client who needed their code to follow accessibility standards, and optimized for search engines. I found that their css styling was a lot longer than it needed to be. Their css had about 200 lines of code which i reduced to about 140. I removed class elements that were not needed. They also had an issue regarding one of their links in the header, it didnt work, so I fixed that allowing it to jump down the page to the desired section.

My motivation for this project was to test my ability to catch repeating code and deal with it by reducing it down and keeping it from overflowing with css that doesn't have to be there.

During this project I learned that there can be a lot of repeating code that doesnt need to be there and still achieve the same outcome. Unnecessary class elements lead to unnecessary css code.
